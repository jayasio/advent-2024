# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2024 Edition. This is my first proper attempt at AoC, so fingers crossed.

Written in TypeScript and executed with Deno. To run it:
1. `cd` into the directory of the day
2. Create a file called `input.txt` with the input data, or `test-input.txt` for the test data from the challenge
3. Run `deno --allow-read main.ts`
